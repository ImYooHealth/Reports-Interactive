Version: 
* Must be d3v4 as required by violins with jitter

https://d3-graph-gallery.com/barplot.html


Update:
* Todo for Friday: combine jitter-halfviolin with barplot variable data and call it done.


Questions:
* How many bins for the violin plot?
  - num_bins = int(2 * numpy.ceil(numpy.power(len(values), 1 / 3)))
    > Rice's rule
  - Consider also trying Sturge's rule. 

Todo:
1. Add additional column to distinguish between this participant and everyone else.
* Add attributions for folks who inspired parts of the code
* Check for GPL
* Use |stat|
